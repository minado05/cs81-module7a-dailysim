# Reflection â€“ Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?

I chose my activities based on personal routine on weekdays as well as what I did yesterday.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?

One challenge I faced was adding multiple statements to run at the same time using`setTimeout`. I figured that I had to use curly braces along with semicolons for it to work.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?

With a regular script, everything would have been shown at the same time. Whereas with this script, we can sequence the activities to appear at different times to simulate how the day goes.

## What creative element did you add?

I added emojis that are descriptive of my activities and also surpise emojis to mark important times of the day.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?

My simulation accurately represents the relative durations of my activities, even though it runs much faster than a real day.
